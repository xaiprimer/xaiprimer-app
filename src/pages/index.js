                  Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) processes typically
                  combine various explanation and verification strategies to
                  support the analysis in different domains.
                  <br></br>
                  We propose an exploratory interface depicting both XAI strategies and applications to
                  support designers conceptualizing and developing new projects.
                  <br></br>
                  The XAI Primer is designed based on the metaphor of a
                  museum. Designers can explore the presented ideation space as
                  if they were artists visiting an art gallery. We enable
                  serendipitous and guided explorations, allowing them to
                  investigate and probe the state of the art as a source of
                  inspiration.
